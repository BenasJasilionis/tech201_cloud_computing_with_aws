# What is AWS
* Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. Millions of customers—including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies—are using AWS to lower costs, become more agile, and innovate faster.
* Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale
## Benefits of AWS
* `Easy to use` - AWS is designed to allow application providers, ISVs, and vendors to quickly and securely host your applications – whether an existing application or a new SaaS-based application. You can use the AWS Management Console or well-documented web services APIs to access AWS’s application hosting platform.
* `Flexible` - AWS enables you to select the operating system, programming language, web application platform, database, and other services you need. With AWS, you receive a virtual environment that lets you load the software and services your application requires. This eases the migration process for existing applications while preserving options for building new solutions.
* `Cost-Effective1` - You pay only for the compute power, storage, and other resources you use, with no long-term contracts or up-front commitments. For more information on comparing the costs of other hosting alternatives with AWS, see the AWS Economics Center.
* `Reliable` - With AWS, you take advantage of a scalable, reliable, and secure global computing infrastructure, the virtual backbone of Amazon.com’s multi-billion dollar online business that has been honed for over a decade.
* `Scalable and high-performance` - Using AWS tools, Auto Scaling, and Elastic Load Balancing, your application can scale up or down based on demand. Backed by Amazon’s massive infrastructure, you have access to compute and storage resources when you need them.
* `Secure` - AWS utilizes an end-to-end approach to secure and harden our infrastructure, including physical, operational, and software measures. For more information, see the AWS Security Center.
## Types of cloud services- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
* Provides acces to networking features, computers (virtual or dedicated hardware) and data storage space.
* Save money on hardware costs
* REduce maintenance of on premise data centers -> delegate to larger firms with more security options.
* Bypass complexity of managing physical servers and datacenter infrastructure
### Advantages
* Security
* Reduced upfront cost
* Stability, reliability, supportability
* Helps scale up or down as needed- elastic
### Examples
* AWS
* Microsoft Azure
* Google cloud
* Digital Ocean
* Linode
## Platform as a Service (PaaS)
* Include the previous features of IaaS, and also: middleware (software that applications use to communicate with each other), development tools,business intelligence services, database management services, Os, runtime ( any library, framework or platform that code runs on e.g. built in functions)
### Advantages
* Cut coding time 
* Use sophisticated tools affordably
* Add development capabilities without extra staff
### Examples
* AWS elastic beanstalk (used for deploying and scaling web applications and services)
* Heroku
* Google App engine
## Software as a Service(SaaS)
* Connect to cloud based apps over the internet
* Provides complete software solutions which you rent
* Provider handles -> hardware, middleware, app software and app data
### Advantages
* Gain access to sophisticated applications
* Pay for what you use -> services scale up and down (elasticity)
* Use free client software -> most apps can be run through a browser without additional software downloads
* Access data form anywhere -> data is stored on the cloud which allows you to access from anywhere and any device
### Examples
* Microsoft teams
* Email
* Microsoft office services
* Netflix
## Capital expenditure vs Opertional expenditure
* `Capital expenditures` are a company's major, long-term expenses
* `Operating expenses` are a company's day-to-day expenses
* Cloud computing helps minimise `capital expenditures` , as services and can be scaled up/ down as needed.
* Previously, companies would have massive `capital expenditure` due to having to predict demand for their services far into the future, now they can respond to demand in near enough real time.
